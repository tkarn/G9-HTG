## This resource contains the following data regarding the analyses described in the paper:



1. [*2023-07-20-G9-HTG-Suppl.pdf*](https://github.com/tkarn/G9-HTG/blob/master/2023-07-20-G9-HTG-Suppl.pdf):  An R-Markdown file of the analyses and generation of figures in the paper based on OR and HR data for 2549 genes from the HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel measured on the HTG-Molecular EdgeSeq-platform. This file also includes validation analyses and figures in three additional TNBC cohorts with RNA-Seq data for the respective genes.
2. [*2023-07-20-G9-HTG-Suppl.R*](https://github.com/tkarn/G9-HTG/blob/master/2023-07-20-G9-HTG-Suppl.R):  The R-script which generates this R-Markdown file and the output below.

## Sub-Directory [*Input*](https://github.com/tkarn/G9-HTG/blob/master/Input/) contains:
1. [*G9_combined_results_all_genes_18JUL2023.xlsx*](https://github.com/tkarn/G9-HTG/blob/master/Input/G9_combined_results_all_genes_18JUL2023.xlsx):  An MS-Excel file containing response (pCR) and survival (DDFS) data separately for each GeparNuevo treatment arm for all 2549 HTG-genes as well as longditudinal changes in expression during treatment together with pathway annotation of the genes. This file provides the input data for all analyses on GeparNuevo samples in the R-script above.
2. [*valid_datasets_HTG.RData*](https://github.com/tkarn/G9-HTG/blob/master/Input/valid_datasets_HTG.RData):  An R-data file containing both clinical data and RNA-seq data for the 2549 HTG-genes from three validation cohorts. This file provides the input data for the validation analyses in the R-script above.
